# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction – Logistic Regression (Supervised Learning Project)

This is a **supervised machine learning project** that predicts whether a loan application should be **approved or rejected** based on applicant information.

I used a **Logistic Regression model** to solve this **binary classification** problem using a realistic dataset of 500+ synthetic loan records. This project is part of my portfolio to demonstrate practical machine learning skills with real-world business context.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In the banking and financial industry, it's critical to automate the loan approval process using data. This project aims to build a **predictive model** that determines loan eligibility based on various features like:

- Applicant income
- Co-applicant income
- Loan amount
- Credit history
- Employment status
- Marital status
- Education level
